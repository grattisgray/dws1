		<h3>What is Origami?</h3>
			<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origami">
				<p>Origami is the art of paper folding, which is often associated with Japanese culture. In modern usage, the word<br> "origami" is used as an inclusive term for all folding practices, regardless of their culture of origin. The goal is<br> to transform a flat sheet of paper into a finished sculpture through folding and sculpting techniques. Modern<br> origami practitioners generally discourage the use of cuts, glue, or markings on the paper.

		<h3>The History and Origin of Origami</h3>
			<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_origami">
				<p>The Japanese word "Origami" itself is a compound of two smaller Japanese words: "oru", meaning to fold, and<br/> "kami", meaning paper. Until recently, all forms of paper folding were not grouped under the word origami, namely<br/> "tsutsumi", a kind of wrapper used for formal occasions. Before that, paperfolding for play was known by a variety<br/> of names, including "orikata", "orisue", "orimono", "tatamigami" and others. Exactly why "origami" became the<br/> common name is not known; it has been suggested that the word was adopted in the kindergartens because the written<br/> characters were easier for young children to write. Another theory is that the word "origami" was a direct translation<br/> of the German word "Papierfalten", brought into Japan with the Kindergarten Movement around 1880.
