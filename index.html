			<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origami">
				<p>Origami is the art of paper folding, which is often associated with Japanese culture. In modern usage, the word<br> "origami" is used as an inclusive term for all folding practices, regardless of their culture of origin. The goal is<br> to transform a flat sheet of paper into a finished sculpture through folding and sculpting techniques. Modern<br> origami practitioners generally discourage the use of cuts, glue, or markings on the paper.

			<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_origami">
				<p>The Japanese word "Origami" itself is a compound of two smaller Japanese words: "oru", meaning to fold, and<br/> "kami", meaning paper. Until recently, all forms of paper folding were not grouped under the word origami, namely<br/> "tsutsumi", a kind of wrapper used for formal occasions. Before that, paperfolding for play was known by a variety<br/> of names, including "orikata", "orisue", "orimono", "tatamigami" and others. Exactly why "origami" became the<br/> common name is not known; it has been suggested that the word was adopted in the kindergartens because the written<br/> characters were easier for young children to write. Another theory is that the word "origami" was a direct translation<br/> of the German word "Papierfalten", brought into Japan with the Kindergarten Movement around 1880.

				<h4>Techniques</h4>
				<p>Many origami books begin with a description of basic origami techniques which are used to construct the models.<br/> This includes simple diagrams of basic folds like valley and mountain folds, pleats, reverse folds, squash folds, and sinks.<br/> There are also standard named bases which are used in a wide variety of models, for instance the bird base is an<br/> intermediate stage in the construction of the flapping bird.[9] Additional bases are the preliminary base (square base),<br/> fish base, waterbomb base, and the frog base.

				<h4>Materials</h4>
					
						<strong>Origami Paper</strong>
							<p>Almost any laminar (flat) material can be used for folding; the only requirement is that it should hold a crease.</p>

							<p>Origami paper, often referred to as "kami" (Japanese for paper), is sold in prepackaged squares of various sizes<br/> ranging from 2.5 cm (1 in) to 25 cm (10 in) or more. It is commonly colored on one side and white on the other;<br/> however, dual coloured and patterned versions exist and can be used effectively for color-changed models.<br/> Origami paper weighs slightly less than copy paper, making it suitable for a wider range of models.</p>

							<p>Normal copy paper with weights of 70–90 g/m2 can be used for simple folds, such as the crane and waterbomb.<br/> Heavier weight papers of (19–24 &amp;nb 100 g/m2 (approx. 25 lb) or more can be wet-folded. This technique allows<br/> for a more rounded sculpting of the model, which becomes rigid and sturdy when it is dry.</p>

							<p>Foil-backed paper, as its name implies, is a sheet of thin foil glued to a sheet of thin paper. Related to this is tissue foil,<br/> which is made by gluing a thin piece of tissue paper to kitchen aluminium foil. A second piece of tissue can be glued<br/> onto the reverse side to produce a tissue/foil/tissue sandwich. Foil-backed paper is available commercially, but not tissue<br/> foil; it must be handmade. Both types of foil materials are suitable for complex models.</p>
						<strong>Tools</strong>
							<p>Common tools to use while creating origami are flat surfaces (such as a table or desk), a ruler, scissors, and paperclips.</p>
